A very important observation:
1. After center-croping the groundtruth image, remember to "DROP" the out-of-boundary
   bounding boxes. Otherwise, since the cropped bounding-boxes have appearances similiar
   to occluded objects yet are labeled foreground, the training dataset will include
   contraditory data as true occluded objects labeled as background and cropped foreground
   labeled as foreground. This is a reason for the stuck of loss decreasing.
